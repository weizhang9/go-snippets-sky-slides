This repo is corresponding to the `Introduction to Golang` [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QzssE9pLuNf9YC8ASu7rwwmDsp2zHypni6az6m2uJ4M/edit?usp=sharing)

To run code in this repo locally, first install go from https://golang.org/doc/install on your machine and set up necessary env vars and directory structures (normally your go workspace would be consisted of 3 directories, i.e. `bin/` (binaries), `pkg/` (compiled packages and deployment config) and `src/` (human code that you wrote); then clone this repo to your machine.

Each directory that contains a `main.go` should be treated as an individual package (of course they are not reusable packages, they are just code snippets as illustrations to fundamental golang syntax and charastics), therefore you should `cd` into any package and run command `go run main.go` or specifiy the path to the `main.go` from your current location after `go run` (e.g. if you are in root directory of the repo and would like to run `data-store-in-bits/main.go`, run `go run awesome-bit-operations/data-store-in-bits/main.go` or `go build awesome-bit-operations/data-store-in-bits/main.go` to build the binary first and execute the binary instead if you prefer that way). If you do `go build` you would be able to see executables and binaries in your `bin/` and `pkg/` directories.

If you don't want to run it locally, you can click into the go playground links on the slides, and run it there; though playground can't show multi-processor goroutines, or any server operations.
